Fluid Simulation on CPU.

The unity package containing the whole project: FluidSim.unitypackage
To run the unity project, the unitypackage can be imported into a Unity project and load the FluidSimScene scene. Then, the Plane GameObject has to be set to the "Plane" layer. The simulation can then be run.

Scripts used in the project: 
    UI_handler.cs - contains code for the UI menu.
    NS_Fluid.cs - contains the calculations for the simulation.
