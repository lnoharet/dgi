Fluid Simulation on CPU in Unity.

The unity package containing the whole project: FluidSim.unitypackage
To run the unity project, the unitypackage can be imported into a Unity project and load the FluidSimScene scene. Then, the Plane GameObject has to be set to the "Plane" layer. The simulation can then be run.

The scripts used in the project are: 
    UI_handler.cs - contains code for the UI menu.
    NS_Fluid.cs - contains the calculations for the simulation.
